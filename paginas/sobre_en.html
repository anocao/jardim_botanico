    The Botanical Garden of Curitiba, or Francisca Richbieter Botanical Garden, is one of the main tourist attractions of the city of Curitiba, capital of the Brazilian state of Paraná. It is located in the Jardim Botânico neighborhood.  Its official name (J.B. Francisca Richbieter) pays homage to the urbanist Francisca Maria Garfunkel Rischbieter, one of the pioneers in the work of urban planning of the capital of Paraná.
   <br>
   <br>
   The entire Botanical Garden has a total area of 278 thousand square meters, including the forest with preserved Atlantic forest. The garden contains numerous plant specimens from Brazil and other countries, scattered throughout alleys and greenhouses of iron and glass, the main one with three vaults of the Art Nouveau style was inspired by the Crystal Palace of London, of the nineteenth century. 
   The greenhouse is air-conditioned and maintains species from the Atlantic Forest such as Caraguatá, Caetê and Palmito. The project is by the architect Abrão Assad, who also planned the Botanical Museum, incorporated into the Botanical Garden in 1992, with auditorium, research center, space for specialized library and temporary and permanent exhibition room.  
    <br>
    <br>
    The greenhouse houses plants characteristic of the Atlantic forest of Brazil. Its architecture, in metallic structure and art-noveau style, was inspired by a crystal palace that existed in London in the 19th century.

    The Botanical Garden also has the Municipal Botanical Museum, trails in the araucaria forest, lake, sports courts and a velodrome.  <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Currently, the Botanical Museum of Curitiba has the fourth largest herbarium in the country, with about 400,000 dried plants and, of course, a large number of wood and fruit samples.
    But not only that, in addition to the incredible collections mentioned, the park also has a botanical research center in the state of Paraná and in Brazil. It is worth visiting and knowing more about the collections and research carried out by the Botanical Garden of Curitiba.
    <br>
    <br>
    The main conservatory features three Art Nouveau vaults. The greenhouse is fully heated and houses species from the Atlantic Forest.
    It is a super privilege to see the French garden from its interior. When we think of the Botanical Garden of Curitiba, the first thing that comes to mind is the main greenhouse.
    <br>
    <br>
    The best time to visit the Botanical Garden of Curitiba is between April and May, after all, it is when the temperatures are milder. That way, it is wonderful to take walks in the open air.

    ⤷ How to get to the Botanical Garden of Curitiba
</ul>

<p>
  The Botanical Garden of Curitiba is not in the center of the city as many think, it is close to the Municipal Botanical Museum and the Railway Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the easiest ways to get to the place is by using the tourist bus, which runs every day and passes through the main sights of Curitiba. 
  <br>
  <br>
  If you are going to visit the Botanical Garden through the tour bus, the transport card costs R $ 50, valid for 24 hours. Children up to 5 years old can use the transport card free of charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you want to go by car, keep in mind that the parking is very small, so you need to arrive early to get a spot.</p>
